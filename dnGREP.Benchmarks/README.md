# dnGREP.Benchmarks

Benchmarks for the non-multiline text search path (reading one line at a time), mainly to measure
memory use and GC pressure with very long lines. Always run in **Release** (x64), outside the debugger.

Test files are generated on first use in `%TEMP%\dnGREP.Benchmarks` and reused. The default file size is
64 MB; set the `DNGREP_BENCH_MB` environment variable to change it. A line length of `0` means the
whole file is a single line.

## BenchmarkDotNet micro benchmarks

```
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- --filter *EolReaderBenchmarks*
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- --filter *PlainTextEngineBenchmarks*
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- --list flat
```

* `EolReaderBenchmarks`: the line reader alone, compared with `StreamReader.ReadLine`.
* `PlainTextEngineBenchmarks`: one file through `GrepEnginePlainText` (plain text, whole word, regex)
  for combinations of line length, line ending and match density.

The memory diagnoser is on. Compare `Allocated` and the `Gen2` column: large object heap allocations
are counted as Gen2. The job is a short run; add `--iterationCount 15 --warmupCount 3` for more precision.
Save a baseline before changing code, e.g. `--exporters json`, and compare the results folders
under `BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts`.

## Peak memory of a whole search

BenchmarkDotNet does not report peak process memory, so this runs the real `GrepCore` search (with
encoding detection and the parallel search option) over several files in one process:

```
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- peak --length 0 --files 8 --mb 64 --density Sparse
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- peak --help
```

It reports peak private bytes, peak working set, peak managed heap, total allocations, GC counts and
pause time, and the memory retained after the search with the results alive and after they are released.
`--csv results.csv --label baseline` appends a row so runs before and after a change can be compared.
The exit code is 2 if the match count differs from what the generated files contain.

`--multiline` searches each file as a whole, and `--budget N` sets the search memory budget in MB
(0 = automatic, a quarter of the available memory). A very large budget turns the limit off, which
gives a baseline for the memory gate that holds back large files when the search runs in parallel.

## Generating test files to use outside the benchmarks

`generate` writes a set of files to any folder, so dnGrep, Process Explorer or another build can be
tried on the same data:

```
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- generate --out D:\data --files 300 --min-mb 100 --max-mb 400 --sizes 7
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- generate --out D:\zips --files 20 --mb 200 --zip
dotnet run -c Release -p:Platform=x64 -- generate --help
```

The files hold random lowercase words and the text `needle` at the chosen density, searchable with plain text,
whole word and regex. `--min-mb`, `--max-mb` and `--sizes` vary the file sizes, `--length` sets the line length
(0 = one line per file), `--eol` the line ending, and `--zip` puts each file in its own archive. Files of the same
size are copies of each other. `manifest.csv` in the output folder lists the expected number of matches
per file, to check search results against. The command stops if the folder has too little free disk space.
